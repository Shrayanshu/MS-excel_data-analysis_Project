Project Description:

This data analysis project focuses on analyzing the sales and customer data of Vrinda store, a retail company, to uncover insights and provide recommendations for business growth. Using various data analysis techniques, this project aims to optimize inventory management, identify customer behavior patterns, and improve overall sales performance.

Key Features:

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted comprehensive EDA on sales and customer data to gain a deep understanding of the dataset and identify any data quality issues.
    Sales Analysis: Analyzed sales data to identify top-selling products, peak sales periods, and seasonal trends, enabling better inventory management and demand forecasting.
    Customer Segmentation: Utilized clustering algorithms to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior, allowing for targeted marketing campaigns and personalized recommendations.
    Churn Analysis: Identified factors contributing to customer churn and developed strategies to minimize churn rate, such as loyalty programs or personalized offers.
    Sales Performance Dashboard: Built an interactive dashboard using Python visualization libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn) to track key sales metrics, monitor performance, and facilitate data-driven decision-making.

Through this project, valuable insights were derived, including actionable recommendations to optimize inventory, improve customer retention, and enhance overall sales performance. The code and findings are documented in this repository to showcase the methodology and provide a reference for future data analysis projects
